* Dotfiles

A collection of configuration files for emacs, tmux, zsh, etc.

To deploy, I store these files in an ~etc~ directory, and use [[http://www.gnu.org/software/stow][stow]] to link
them into my home directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
stow -t$HOME emacs tmux zsh
#+END_SRC

When you run Emacs for the first time, it'll fetch packages from [[http://melpa.milkbox.net][melpa]], so may take a
while.
