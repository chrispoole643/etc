Spell word at point (Usually M-$):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-s") 'ispell-word)
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-S") 'dictionary-lookup-definition)
#+END_SRC

I often hit C-x s by mistaken when I want C-x C-s, so bind it to the same command:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x s") 'save-buffer)
#+END_SRC

Backward kill word is used so often that this is useful, but kill-region is
still needed, so move to C-x C-k:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-w") 'backward-kill-word)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-k") 'kill-region)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-k") 'kill-region)
#+END_SRC

Since re-mapped C-w to backward-kill-word, and moved cut option to C-\, should move copy
command too (M-w -> M-\). Re-map old M-\ -> M-w:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-w") 'delete-horizontal-space)
  ;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-\\") 'kill-ring-save)
  ;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-#") 'kill-ring-save)
#+END_SRC

M-/ is used often to expand words as a basic tab completion, so map command to somewhere
easier to press quickly, M-o (previously undefined), or M-i if I miss 'o' with my
fingers.  M-/ also now bound to undo-tree-redo:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-o") 'dabbrev-expand)
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-i") 'dabbrev-expand)
#+END_SRC

C-' is bound to =helm-semantic-or-imenu=; use this instead:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-\"") 'other-window)
#+END_SRC

C-h h is usually view-hello-file. Forget it, and use handy C-h C-h to lookup stuff in
info docs:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-h h") 'help-for-help)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-h C-h") 'cjp-lookup-thing-at-point)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-h C-u") 'cjp-load-url-w3m)
#+END_SRC

Open the current buffer with privileges given by /sudo/:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-V") 'find-alternative-file-with-sudo)
#+END_SRC
